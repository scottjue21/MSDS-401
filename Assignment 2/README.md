# Assignment 2 Overview
The assignment is designed to test the student's understanding of statistical distributions, probability functions, hypothesis testing, and data visualization using R. The assignment consists of five sections, each focused on specific skills in R programming and statistical analysis.

## Section 1: Probability Distributions
### Objective:
Approximate the binomial distribution using Poisson and normal distributions.
### Key Tasks:
- Compute binomial probabilities using Poisson and normal approximations.
- Compare results with exact binomial probabilities.
- Visualize the distributions using bar plots.
- Calculate expected value and variance for a discrete distribution and find the median.

## Section 2: Conditional Probability & Correlation
### Objective:
Analyze relationships between variables and test for dependency.
### Key Tasks:
- Use the "faithful" dataset to explore conditional probabilities and correlations between eruption times and waiting times.
- Visualize the data with scatterplots, and test independence using Kendall's tau.

## Section 3: Hypothesis Testing
### Objective:
Perform hypothesis tests on two different datasets.
### Key Tasks:
- Compare the weights of chicks on two different diets using t-tests.
- Analyze paired data to examine weight changes over time and calculate confidence intervals for the average weight gain.

## Section 4: Central Limit Theorem & Sampling Distribution
### Objective:
Demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem through sampling distribution analysis.
### Key Tasks:
- Use the Nile River flow data to calculate skewness and kurtosis.
- Simulate random sampling and calculate sample means for different sample sizes, visualizing the results.

## Section 5: Contingency Table Analysis
### Objective:
Conduct a categorical data analysis using contingency tables.
### Key Tasks:
- Analyze the "warpbreaks" dataset to explore the relationship between breaks and tension levels.
- Create contingency tables and perform chi-squared tests for independence.

This assignment tests proficiency in statistical functions, hypothesis testing, and R visualization techniques.
