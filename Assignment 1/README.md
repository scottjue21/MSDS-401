# Assignment Overview
This R assignment tests proficiency in key areas of data analysis and programming, including:

1. **Vector Manipulation:** Create, modify, and analyze vectors, including calculating statistics (sum, length) and filtering based on conditions.
   
2. **User-Defined Functions & Plotting:** Implement trigonometric functions, find minimum and maximum values, and generate informative plots with labels and annotations.
   
3. **Function Intersection:** Solve problems involving the intersection of mathematical functions and visualize results using overlaid plots.
   
4. **Dataset Analysis (Using the "trees" Dataset):** Load a dataset, calculate statistics (means, interquartile range), and visualize the data using histograms. Identify specific data points based on conditions.
   
5. **Distribution Comparison (Student's t and Normal Distributions):** Compare distributions by generating samples, calculating interquartile ranges, and visualizing results using histograms, boxplots, and QQ plots.

Each section emphasizes practical applications of statistical concepts and data visualization using R, ensuring well-rounded development of coding and analytical skills.
