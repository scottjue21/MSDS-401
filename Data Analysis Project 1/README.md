# Data Analysis 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Abalone Dataset

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of abalone data to identify potential reasons why a previous study failed to accurately predict abalone age using physical measurements. The dataset contains observations from an abalone study conducted in Tasmania, with variables such as length, diameter, height, weight, and ring count (used to estimate age). The objective of this project is to analyze the data, derive meaningful insights, and assess whether the physical characteristics of abalones can be reliably used to estimate their age.

## Key Tasks:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and relationships within the data.
   
2. Identify any limitations or issues that could explain why the original study's predictive model was unsuccessful.
   
3.Generate additional features such as abalone **volume** (calculated from physical dimensions) and **meat-to-volume ratio** to aid in the analysis.

Variables include physical measurements like length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked meat weight, and age classification based on rings.
